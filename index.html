    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p class="about-us">
Founded in 2023 by the An Nguyen, ANB High School is a co-educational, semestered school located in northwest Etobicoke. <br>

Our school has a rich tradition of academics, athletics, and extra-curricular activities. Numerous championship banners adorn the gym walls. Our dramatic productions, art exhibits, drum-line and musical performances are visible demonstrations of our school’s spirit. <br>

Our school is also rich in community spirit. The saying “We Will Win When We Want” is reflective of the day-to-day operation of the school. <br>

Our school motto, “Domine ut videam” - “Lord that I might see,” expresses the goal of the Henry Carr community - to promote, in the fullest sense, each student's growth as a person. <br>
